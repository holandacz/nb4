INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE MILLION PIXEL SCRIPT (R) VERSION 3

Thank you for buying the Million Pixel Script (R)!
Please read these instructions carefully in order to successfully install your PHP Pixel Script
on your server/webspace.

For questions, bug fixes, and updates go to:
http://millionhelp.texmedia.de


Requirements for the successful installation of the Million Pixel Script:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- A domain with a Webhost that provides:
  > PHP 4.3 or higher with an installed GD library (this normally standard)
  > MySQL database
  > min. 20 MB Webspace


Installation procedure
--------------------------------------------------------

1. UNZIP:
   Unzip "MPScript3PRO.zip" and save the files to your local computer.

2. DATABASE:
   Create a MYSQL-database (i.e. with the name: milliondata) on your webserver,
   either with a database management software like PHPMyAdmin or via your
   hosting management account (look for menu items like 'mysql' or 'database').
   Create a MYSQL-user and add this user to your database with all rights.

3. UPLOAD:
   Upload all files AND folders FROM the unzipped folder "public_html" TO YOUR hosting webservers public html
   directory. This is mostly also a directory called "public_html" or sometimes "html" or "web".

4. WRITE PERMISSIONS:
   If you are using a unix server you need to give write permission to some files and
   folders of the script, so that the script itself can save and change with these files.
   You can set these writeable attributes (which is called "chmod 777" in unix language)
   with your FTP client software you used for uploading the script files before.
   Just select the listed files and folders, and set the attributes to 777 (please search
   in your FTP client software where you find this option).
   It is strongly necessary to give all of the following files and folders write permission:

    DIRECTORIES:    - control/mailtemp
                    - grids
                    - incs
                    - lang
                    - lang/en
                    - lang/..   (other languages if you want)
                    - mydir


    FILES:          - grids/...     -> ALL files in directory "grids"
                    - lang/en/      -> all files here in this directory
                    - lang/../      -> other language directory files, if you'd like to use them

   If you own a windows hosting/server you need to make sure that the listed files and directories
   have also write permissions set. Please contact your provider if you get problems with this step,
   he should help you or do this step for you.

5. MYSQL:
   Start your website now and you will forwarded automatically to the MYSQL-Installation process.
   Type in the necessary data, which will be:

        MYSQL username      --> Username of your mysql-server connection
        MYSQL password      --> Password of your mysql-server connection
        MYSQL database name --> Name of your created database for the script (i.e. 'milliondata')
        MYSQL hosting name  --> Hostname of the mysql-server (normally 'localhost' or 'mysql')

   If you insert the right data, the tables will be created into the database (which you created
   in step 2). If you don't know the MYSQL data you have to insert, please ask your provider for
   this.

6. DELETE INSTALL:
   If the MYSQL-Installation process was successfull, your site is ready now.
   Please delete the folder "install" now from your server!


Finished.


CHECK AND TROUBLE SHOOTING:
--------------------------------------------
See your pixel site working under http://www.yourdomain.com
(Substitute "yourdomain.com" with your domain name).

-> If no site will be shown, try http://www.yourdomain.com/index.php
   If this helps, you have to configure your webserver, that he
   takes first the file 'index.php' if the domain is called. You can do this by
   creating a simple text file with the name ".htaccess" (point htaccess) with
   the following line it it:

   DirectoryIndex index.php

   Save this file in the main directory of your script on your server. It says the
   server, that he has to take the file "index.php" first.

   But normally it is standard and may be you only have to delete the "index.htm" or "index.html" file
   in the main directory of your webserver, cause such files will be taken first.


Check your system by uploading some pixels.

--> If you get a permission error, you will have to recheck, if you did set all permissions
    correct (chmod to 777) and did not forget a file. Please see step 4 and check if you
    really set the permission to all files AND folders listed in this step. Do not set write
    permissions to all files and folders of the whole script package on your server, that
    might be a security risk and some servers will cause an error message instead. Only
    the listed files and folders please.


Problems with sending mails from feedback or Tell-a-friend form?

--> May be your server is very restricted and won't send out messages with other "from" addresses
    than your webmaster address from your server/domain. If so, please put in the fields
    'eMail webmaster' and 'eMail contact form' in the control area of the script (CONFIG)
    your webmaster address of your domain (webmaster@yourdomain.com).

    After this, edit the two following files of the script with a simple texteditor
    (i.e. with notepad -> open the file from notepad, do not double click it to edit):

    feedb.php
    recommend.php

    and delete in line 33 the char # from the beginning of the line, so that there
    will be

    $from = $CONFIG['email_feedback'];

    (instead of #$from = $CONFIG['email_feedback'];)

    Save the files and replace it on your server.
    This could fix your mail send problem.



FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

Please do always take a look to this site before contacting the support via email,
which will need some responds time depending on the daily requests. Thanks.


ADMIN-AREA:
