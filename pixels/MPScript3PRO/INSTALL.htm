<pre><b><font size="4" face="Arial">INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE MILLION PIXEL SCRIPT </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">®</font><font face="Arial" size="4"> PRO VERSION 3</font></b></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial">Thank you for buying the Million Pixel Script PRO!
Please read these instructions carefully in order to successfully install your Million Pixel Script on your server/webspace.</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial">For questions, bug fixes, and updates go to: <a href="http://millionhelp.texmedia.de">http://millionhelp.texmedia.de</a>
</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial"><b><font size="4">Requirements for the successful installation of the Million Pixel Script PRO:</font>

</b>- A domain with a Webhost that provides:
  &gt; PHP 4.3 or higher with an installed GD library (this normally standard)
  &gt; MySQL
</font></pre>
<pre><u><b><font face="Arial" size="4">INSTALLATION</font></b></u><b><font face="Arial" size="4"><u>:</u>
</font></b><font face="Arial"><b><font size="4">
</font><font size="3">1. UNZIP:</font></b><font size="3">
</font>   Unzip &quot;MPScript3PRO.zip&quot; and save the files to your local computer.</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial"><b><font size="3">2. DATABASE:</font></b>
   Create a MYSQL-database (i.e. with the name: milliondata) on your webserver,
   either with a database management software like PHPMyAdmin or via your
   hosting management account (look for menu items like 'mysql' or 'database').
   Create a MYSQL-user and add this user to your database with all rights.</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial"><b><font size="3">3. UPLOAD:</font></b>
   Upload all files AND folders FROM the folder &quot;public_html&quot; TO YOUR hosting webservers public html
   directory. This is mostly also a directory called &quot;public_html&quot; or sometimes &quot;html&quot; or &quot;web&quot;.</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial"><b><font size="3">4. WRITE PERMISSIONS:</font></b>
   If you are using a unix server you need to give write permission to some files and
   folders of the script, so that the script itself can save and change with these files.
   You can set these writeable attributes (which is called &quot;chmod 777&quot; in unix language)
   with your FTP client software you used for upload the script.
   Just select the listed files and folders, and set the attributes to 777 (please search
   in your FTP client software where you find this option).
   It is strongly necessary to give all of the following files and folders write permission:</font></pre>
<pre><b><font color="#0000FF"><font face="Arial">    FOLDERS:	- control/mailtemp
		- grids
		- incs
		- lang
		- lang/de	(only if you'd like to use german language)
		- lang/en	(only if you'd like to use english language)
		- lang/...	(other languages)
		- mydir

    FILES:		- grids/...	-&gt; all files in directory &quot;grids&quot;
</font>		<font face="Arial">- lang/de/	-&gt; all files here in this directory, if you'd like to use german language
		- lang/en/	-&gt; all files here in this directory, if you'd like to use english language
		- lang/../	-&gt; other language directory files</font></font></b></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial">   If you own a windows hosting/server you need to make sure that the listed files and directories
   have also write permissions set. Please contact your provider if you get problems with this step,
   he should help you or do this step for you.</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial"><b><font size="3">5. MYSQL:</font></b>
   Start your website now and you will forwarded automatically to the MYSQL-Installation process.
   Type in the necessary data, which will be:</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial">        MYSQL username      --&gt; Username of your mysql-server connection
        MYSQL password      --&gt; Password of your mysql-server connection
        MYSQL database name --&gt; Name of your created database for the script (i.e. 'milliondata')
        MYSQL hosting name  --&gt; Hostname of the mysql-server (normally 'localhost' or 'mysql')</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial">   If you insert the right data, the tables will be created into the database (which you created
   in step 2). If you don't know the MYSQL data you have to insert, please ask your provider for
   this.</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial"><b><font size="3">6. DELETE INSTALL:</font></b>
   If the MYSQL-Installation process was successfull, your site is ready now.
   Please delete the folder &quot;install&quot; now from your server!
</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial">Finished.
</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial"><u><b><font size="4">ADMIN-AREA:</font></b></u>

In order to access the admin-area, to activate or delete entries and modify the complete system,
you have to go to <i><font color="#0000FF"><b>h</b>ttp://www.yourdomain.com<b>/control/</b></font></i> with the default password &quot;admin&quot; (without quotes).
(<b><i>Substitute &quot;yourdomain.com&quot; with your domain name</i></b>).</font></pre>
<pre><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU TO CHANGE THIS PASSWORD FIRST BEFORE ANY OTHER STEPS.
YOU CAN CHANGE THIS IN THE ADMIN AREA BY CLICKING ON THE 'CONFIG' TAB.</font></b></pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial"><b><font size="4"><u>CHECK AND TROUBLE SHOOTING:</u>
</font></b>
See your pixel site working under http://www.yourdomain.com
(<i><b>Substitute &quot;yourdomain.com&quot; with your domain name</b></i>).</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial">-&gt; If no site will be shown, try http://www.yourdomain.com/index.php
   If this helps, you have to configure your webserver, that he
   takes first the file 'index.php' if the domain is called. You can do this by
   creating a simple text file with the name &quot;.htaccess&quot; (point htaccess) with
   the following line it it:</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial">   DirectoryIndex index.php</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial">   Save this file in the main directory of your script on your server. It says the
   server, that he has to take the file &quot;index.php&quot; first.</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial">   But normally it is standard and may be you only have to delete the &quot;index.htm&quot; or &quot;index.html&quot; file
   in the main directory of your webserver, cause such files will be taken first.
</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial">Check your system by uploading some pixels.</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial">--&gt; If you get a permission error, you will have to recheck, if you did set all permissions
    correct (chmod to 777) and did not forget a file. Please see step 4 and check if you
    really set the permission to all files AND folders listed in this step. Do not set write
    permissions to all files and folders of the whole script package on your server, that
    might be a security risk and some servers will cause an error message instead. Only
    the listed files and folders please.
</font></pre>
<pre><b><font face="Arial">Problems with sending mails from feedback or Tell-a-friend form?</font></b></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial">--&gt; May be your server is very restricted and won't send out messages with other &quot;from&quot; addresses
    than your webmaster address from your server/domain. If so, please put in the fields
    'eMail webmaster' and 'eMail contact form' in the control area of the script (CONFIG)
    your webmaster address of your domain (webmaster@yourdomain.com).</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial">    After this, edit the two following files of the script with a simple texteditor
    (i.e. with notepad -&gt; open the file from notepad, do not double click it to edit):</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial">    feedb.php
    recommend.php</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial">    and delete in line 33 the char # from the beginning of the line, so that there
    will be</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial">    $from = $CONFIG['email_feedback'];</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial">    (instead of #$from = $CONFIG['email_feedback'];)</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Arial">    Save the files and replace it on your server.
    This could fix your mail send problem.
