<p>Yes, it has been 13 years and we are happy to say that we are still number one on the web. A major portion of the over 1,100 average daily visitors find NoBlood on the first page of major search engines when searching for common terms related to bloodless medicine and surgery. And when they arrive they find an active community of medical professionals and members of the public who are sharing their expertise and experience in the form of thousands of comments, questions and answers.</p>
<span style="font-size: 14px;"><p>As the information highway becomes increasingly congested and complicated, a new website called Twitter is taking the world by storm. Twitter has grown into a real-time short messaging service that works over multiple networks and devices. In countries all around the world, people follow sources most relevant to them and access information via Twitter as it happens &mdash; from breaking world news to updates from friends. Register your twitter account and start <a href="http://twitter.com/noblood" target="_blank">following NoBlood</a> today. If you have already discovered Twitter, please be sure to <a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=RT%20@noblood%20Nice%20site%20to%20stay%20up-to-date%20with%20the%20latest%20regarding%20bloodless%20healthcare." title="Post to Twitter"><img title="[Post to Twitter]" class="nothumb" src="http://www.noblood.org/nbZines/imgs/tweet-this.png" alt="[Post to Twitter]" border="0"></a>.</p>

<p>Does your company provide products or services that would be of interest to medical professionals and members of the public who are concerned about the efficacy, cost and availability of donor blood? If so, there is no more cost effective way to reach this important audience. Global Blood Resources, manufacturer of the Hemobag, recently increased their advertising budget, according to Keith A. Samolyk CEO, "Advertising on NoBlood has been the most cost-effect catalyst for reaching such a focused market". If you are affiliated with a company that would like to reach this audience please see our <a href="http://wiki.noblood.org/Advertising" target="_blank">Advertisers Page</a> and <a href="http://www.noblood.org/sendemail/" target="_blank">Contact Us</a> today. See also our <a href="http://www.noblood.org/pixels/healthcare" target="_blank">Healthcare Pixels Page</a>.</p>

<p>From the beginning our commitment has been to provide this resource without charge. As with any tax-exempt charitable organization, we rely upon your generous donations to make this resource possible. It cannot be overstated &mdash; providing this resource requires a substantial commitment of time and money. <a href="http://www.noblood.org/donate">Please take a couple of minutes now</a> to help us share in defraying the growing expenses necessary to make this site possible. Your support is genuinely needed and is greatly appreciated. For the price of a cup of coffee, you can help NoBlood in its mission to advance knowledge and awareness of transfusion alternatives and advanced blood management. Corporate sponsors are also welcome. See our <a href="http://www.noblood.org/pixels/corporate" target="_blank">Corporate Pixels Page</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you &mdash; all of you who are making this site possible.</p>

	<feature_teaser><![CDATA[<br /><p><b>And we have ways of making you talk...</b></p>
<p>Without a doubt, the Ask a Professional Forum, now with over 2,600 topics under discussion, is the most active area on NoBlood.  Members of the public, who perhaps have just become members in the face of a family emergency and have posted a question for the first time, no doubt appreciate any and all timely responses to their questions by concerned healthcare professionals. We may have heard the expression, "There is wisdom in a multitude of counselors." And how true that can be when someone, for instance, that is facing major surgery writes in asking for advice -- and not only several physicians from various specialties share their thoughts, but also a surgical nurse, a bloodless program manager, and perhaps a member who has gone through that problem in the past. Such a collaborative effort, at times involving professional members from all parts of the globe, all contributing their part to the development of a bloodless management strategy â€“ can truly be a satisfying experience for all involved.</p>

<p>Occasionally, though, a thoughtful question gets posted, but some bit of time goes by before replies start showing up. What might be holding some of the health pros that are NoBlood members and regular visitors back from posting an answer Let's address three likely reasons:  </p>


<p><b>1. Fear of Litigation</b></p>
<span style="font-size: 14px;"><p>Most of us in health care have all heard stories about doctors who played the role of a good Samaritan only to get sued by some thankless, perhaps shameless person who was not their actual patient, but they were trying to help. This certainly crossed my mind when I started writing responses in the forum. Fortunately, the <a href="http://www.noblood.org/library-records/296-terms-service.html">Terms of Service</a>, which all new members are required to read, clearly disclaim any potential concerns in this regard. In fact, this is the very first issue addressed. Moreover, the <a href="http://www.noblood.org/about/">Mission Statement</a> reinforces the point that NoBlood is all about discussion and education, not diagnosis and treatment.</p></span>

<p><b>2. Overflowing Cup</b></p>
<span style="font-size: 14px;"><p>The pace of life in the 21st century has put the squeeze on all of us. Healthcare professionals, faced with not only generic pressures but also the struggle to keep up with the literature in their field, which likely is growing exponentially, can have a panic attack when anyone starts talking about adding something to their schedule.
But come on. Reading the last half dozen posted questions, picking one that you have some interest or even better, expertise in, and then typing out a short paragraph can take ten minutes, maybe less. And that would do it for the week.</p></span>

<p><b>3. Just Too Complicated</b></p>
<span style="font-size: 14px;"><p>Yes, first time or infrequent visitors to NoBlood may feel the site was designed by someone that was drinking a little too much coffee. Lots of bells and whistles. But when you actually get down to the forum level, and do that a few times, the process goes pretty quick.
If there is something special you would like to do, such as uploading a PDF, but aren't sure quite how to do that, do not hesitate to <a href="http://www.noblood.org/pm/new/to-1481/">Private Message</a> me or submit a question using the <a href="http://www.noblood.org/sendemail/">Contact Us</a> form. We will try to help.</p>
