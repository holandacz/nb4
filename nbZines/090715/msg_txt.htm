  [http://www.noblood.org/about/]
  Yes, it has been 13 years and we are happy to say that we are
still number one on the web. A major portion of the over 1,100
average daily visitors find NoBlood on the first page of major
search engines when searching for common terms related to
bloodless medicine and surgery. And when they arrive they find an
active community of medical professionals and members of the
public who are sharing their expertise and experience in the form
of thousands of comments, questions and answers.
  As the information highway becomes increasingly congested and
complicated, a new website called Twitter is taking the world by
storm. Twitter has grown into a real-time short messaging service
that works over multiple networks and devices. In countries all
around the world, people follow sources most relevant to them and
access information via Twitter as it happens &mdash; from breaking
world news to updates from friends. Register your twitter account
and start following NoBlood today. If you have already discovered
Twitter, please be sure to .
  
  Does your company provide products or services that would be of
interest to medical professionals and members of the public who
are concerned about the efficacy, cost and availability of donor
blood? If so, there is no more cost effective way to reach this
important audience. Global Blood Resources, manufacturer of the
Hemobag, recently increased their advertising budget, according to
Keith A. Samolyk CEO, "Advertising on NoBlood has been the most
cost-effect catalyst for reaching such a focused market". If you
are affiliated with a company that would like to reach this
audience please see our Advertisers Page and Contact Us today. See
also our Healthcare Pixels Page.
  
  From the beginning our commitment has been to provide this
resource without charge. As with any tax-exempt charitable
organization, we rely upon your generous donations to make this
resource possible. It cannot be overstated &mdash; providing this
resource requires a substantial commitment of time and money.
Please take a couple of minutes now to help us share in defraying
the growing expenses necessary to make this site possible. Your
support is genuinely needed and is greatly appreciated. For the
price of a cup of coffee, you can help NoBlood in its mission to
advance knowledge and awareness of transfusion alternatives and
advanced blood management. Corporate sponsors are also welcome.
See our Corporate Pixels Page.
  Thank you &mdash; all of you who are making this site possible.

  And we have ways of making you talk...
  Without a doubt, the Ask a Professional Forum, now with over
2,600 topics under discussion, is the most active area on NoBlood.
 Members of the public, who perhaps have just become members in
the face of a family emergency and have posted a question for the
first time, no doubt appreciate any and all timely responses to
their questions by concerned healthcare professionals. We may have
heard the expression, "There is wisdom in a multitude of
counselors." And how true that can be when someone, for instance,
that is facing major surgery writes in asking for advice -- and
not only several physicians from various specialties share their
thoughts, but also a surgical nurse, a bloodless program manager,
and perhaps a member who has gone through that problem in the
past. Such a collaborative effort, at times involving professional
members from all parts of the globe, all contributing their part
to the development of a bloodless management strategy â€“ can
truly be a satisfying experience for all involved.
  
  Occasionally, though, a thoughtful question gets posted, but
some bit of time goes by before replies start showing up. What
might be holding some of the health pros that are NoBlood members
and regular visitors back from posting an answer Let's address
three likely reasons:
  
  
  1. Fear of Litigation
  Most of us in health care have all heard stories about doctors
who played the role of a good Samaritan only to get sued by some
thankless, perhaps shameless person who was not their actual
patient, but they were trying to help. This certainly crossed my
mind when I started writing responses in the forum. Fortunately,
the Terms of Service, which all new members are required to read,
clearly disclaim any potential concerns in this regard. In fact,
this is the very first issue addressed. Moreover, the Mission
Statement reinforces the point that NoBlood is all about
discussion and education, not diagnosis and treatment.
  
  2. Overflowing Cup
  The pace of life in the 21st century has put the squeeze on all
of us. Healthcare professionals, faced with not only generic
pressures but also the struggle to keep up with the literature in
their field, which likely is growing exponentially, can have a
panic attack when anyone starts talking about adding something to
their schedule.
  But come on. Reading the last half dozen posted questions,
picking one that you have some interest or even better, expertise
in, and then typing out a short paragraph can take ten minutes,
maybe less. And that would do it for the week.
  
  3. Just Too Complicated
  Yes, first time or infrequent visitors to NoBlood may feel the
site was designed by someone that was drinking a little too much
coffee. Lots of bells and whistles. But when you actually get down
to the forum level, and do that a few times, the process goes
pretty quick.
  If there is something special you would like to do, such as
uploading a PDF, but aren't sure quite how to do that, do not
hesitate to Private Message me or submit a question using the
Contact Us form. We will try to help.

== PRESS RELEASE: NEW MANAGER, NORTHEAST BAPTIST HOSPITAL ========

  Bloodless Medicine and Blood Conservation
  Baptist Health System
  San Antonio, TX
  Mary Anne Rouch has joined the team at Northeast as our new
Bloodless Medicine Manager. She comes to us from Texas Health
System and brings with her 15 years of experience coordinating and
managing Bloodless Medicine. Mary Anne is replacing Alex Miller,
RN. President Matt Stone says, "We are happy to have Ms. Rouch on
board to continue developing this exciting line of business. She
has our full support."
  
  Ms. Rouch has successfully developed and operated numerous
bloodless and blood conservation programs in Texas and has
assisted many others. During her tenure with Texas Health System
she reduced blood utilization by 10% in the first year and 20% in
the 3rd year of operations. This reduction saved the hospital and
system millions of dollars in blood acquisition costs and improved
the quality of care for many patients.
  
  The Mission Statement
  The Baptist Health System exists to provide the highest quality
in health care delivery, education and community service through a
dedicated team of health care professionals working together in a
compassionate Christian environment. More...
