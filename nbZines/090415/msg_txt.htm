Fortunately, our media correspondent Sharon Grant keeps an eye out
for publications of interest. In the last three months, she has

== PEOPLE ARE TALKING: POPULAR DISCUSSIONS =======================

  Welcome! You've discovered NoBlood, and you like it. But there's
a LOT of information here, and you aren't quite sure where to
start to find information. A good place to look is in the Forums!
This is a part of the site in which users, including health care
providers and the public, post questions, comments, interesting
information and articles on varying topics related to transfusion
alternatives and non-blood management. Information seekers get
answers and make connections with other NoBlood users to exchange
information, resources, and encouragement.
  Each topic is usually posted as a separate thread. The threads
are posted in one of our many forums most relevant to that topic.
  A sample of the most active threads (topics) for the past
quarter are listed and linked to below. The forum in which each
thread is located is followed by the number of views.

      News and Hot Topics such as Hepatitis C, SARS and AIDS  [http://www.noblood.org/forumdisplay.php?f=4]

  If you are a new user, or just haven't felt comfortable posting
anything yet, why not click on the Forums link at the top of the
Home Page (in the light orange strip just below our logo)? Then
scroll down to the Forums lists and maybe post just a hello in the
New Members forum. Or ask that question that's been in the back of
your mind for so long in the Ask A Professional forum. The more
you post, the more you encourage others to respond, which helps
our NoBlood community grow and prosper. Tell your friends to check
out NoBlood, and join the growing number of people contributing to
our wonderful knowledge base.
  As a nurse, and a former paralegal, one of my favorites is the
News and Hot Topics such as Hepatitis C, SARS and AIDS forum. It's
very informative to browse through the various threads, such as
"FDA approves Voluven to treat serious blood volume loss following
surgery" (posted 3/12/2009 by agapay, one of our professional
members). There have already been 615 views of this post in just
three weeks! Or you could learn about "The Path of a Red Blood
Cell" by watching the YouTube video embedded in this post in the
General Discussions forum (posted 1/6/2008, by Sharon Grant, one
of our editors).
  So, welcome to NoBlood.  Whether you are a casual passer-by
looking in for the first time, a new registered user who hasn't
looked around much, a professional seeking information to assist
you in your practice, a student looking for research resources, or
someone with a health problem needing answers to help you make the
best health decisions for you or a loved one. We hope you will
make good use of our many resources.
