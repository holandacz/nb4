  Now that we have successfully moved noblood.org to a more
capable server we must ask for your financial assistance to cover
this expense. We have something to say to our individual users and
to our corporate partners. First allow us to speak to our
corporate friends.

  Our server upgrade creates an opportunity for you. We are
offering a special sponsor relationship to any organization
willing to cover our server expenses for one or more years. The
cost is $10/day or $3,650 for the year. As our server sponsor your
company will receive high visibility on noblood.org.
Please Contact Us [http://www.noblood.org/sendemail/]to discuss
the details or to discuss other available sponsor opportunities.

  Are you an individual who understands the value of NoBlood? Have
you assumed that our corporate sponsors are providing all the
financial assistance we need to operate? This is not the case. If
you have ever watched a Public Television fund drive you know that
MOST of the funding needed to operate a non-profit organization
"Comes from People like YOU!" Our corporate sponsors are
providing only a fraction of what it takes to keep NoBlood alive.
For that reason, we simply MUST ask you to express your
appreciation for our efforts through ongoing donations.

  Why are we confident you will help us? Because of the many
heartfelt messages of appreciation you send us. Why do we find it
necessary to ask you to help us? Last month we received only $35
in Premium User donations from five individuals.

  Remember, we have committed ourselves to produce this website
for YOU. Bear in mind that presently NoBlood operates using NON
SALARIED STAFF.

  Nonetheless, in order to continue, maintain and improve this
growing site we must raise funds. Although there are no plans to
shut down the site the fact remains: Your individual support plays
an important role is determining the quality and content of
NoBlood. We know that you along with tens of thousands of other
visitors appreciate the role NoBlood is playing to promote quality
transfusion alternatives and advance blood management. We are not
comfortable in being so direct, but there is no other way to
inform you of our predicament.

  If we are reaching your heart here please help us care for this
very important website. That being said, here is what you can do
to help.

  Please become a Premium User for $3, $5 or $10 recurring monthly
subscription or any one-time donation in the amount of your
choice. Recurring premium subscriptions from individuals must form
the supportive backbone of NoBlood. To thrive we need the
assistance from a greater percentage of registered users. Please
take a moment now to become a Premium User.
