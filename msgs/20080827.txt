1. New Website: NoBlood Mobile
<http://mobile.noblood.org/?utm_campaign=080827&utm_medium=msg&utm_source=noblood.org&uid=&utm_content=text-only>

We've recently launched a new mobile website at mobile.
noblood.org <http://mobile.noblood.org/?utm_campaign=080827&utm_medium=msg&utm_source=noblood.org&uid=&utm_content=text-only>. The purpose is to provide a convenient and readily available tool to
access resources related to transfusion alternatives
and blood management from your phone or other web-
enabled mobile device.

We are sure you will want to add this website to your
list of mobile phone favorites. Check in from time-to-time
as we continue to add resources that you will appreciate
having readily available wherever you go.
