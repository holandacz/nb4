  <p><strong><a name="now"></a>WHERE ARE WE
    NOW?</strong></p>
  <p>In a
    nutshell, NoBlood.org continues to be the number one resource on the web for
    sharing transfusion alternatives and blood management knowledge and expertise. 
    To illustrate, please take at the look at the following sampling of search
    terms from the first four days of January 2008 and see if you can identify what
    they all have in common:</p>

  <p>What these
    terms have in common is they are all found on the FIRST PAGE of hundreds of
    thousands of pages available when searching Google! Search terms that are
    bolded with asterisks are in the FIRST POSITION on the FIRST PAGE of Google. 
    That means they are the first thing someone see’s when searching for
    information regarding these topics!!! Your results may vary depending on your
    location in the world. Those of you who are familiar with the science of Search
    Engine Optimization (SEO) no doubt appreciate the value of this accomplishment.</p>
  <p>So what is
    the significance of being so well positioned with search engines? It simply means
    that NoBlood is accomplishing a key objective in its mission to advance
    knowledge and awareness of transfusion alternatives and blood management. Yes,
    each month people, numbering in the tens of thousands, come to NoBlood to learn
    about the benefits of this gold standard of healthcare.</p>
  <p><strong><a name="how"></a>HOW HAS THIS
    BEEN POSSIBLE?</strong></p>
  <p>Bloodless
    Healthcare International, Inc., the federally tax-exempt charitable
    organization that publishes NoBlood.org, is not a physician-based association
    such as SABM, NATA, ABC, etc. However, by building a professional, yet family-friendly
    public forum, healthcare professionals and the public freely mingle to share valuable
    knowledge and experience involving real-world cases and outcomes.</p>
  <p>At this time
    I would like to extend special thanks to the following physicians and
    practitioners who have recently shared in helping us to develop some of our
    most popular features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Aryeh Shander MD - <a href="http://www.noblood.org/wiki/Erythropoietin_%28EPO%29" target="_blank">Erythropoietin (EPO)</a></li>
    <li>Paul Loubser MD - <a href="http://www.noblood.org/wiki/Acute_Normovolemic_Hemodilution" target="_blank">Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution (ANH)</a> <a href="http://www.noblood.org/wiki/Epidural_Blood_Patch">Epidural Blood Patch</span></a></li>
    <li>Malcolm Chambers ODP - <a href="http://www.noblood.org/wiki/Intraoperative_blood_salvage" target="_blank">Intraoperative blood salvage</a></li>
    <li>Bassam F. Matar, MD - <a href="http://www.noblood.org/wiki/Polyheme" target="_blank">Polyheme</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>One of
    NoBlood’s most popular forums is entitled “Ask A Professional” where healthcare
    professionals regularly answer questions posted by our registered users. I
    can’t mention them all here, but I would like to extend special thanks to Jan B.
    Wade, Jan Grossberg RN, Jan Graziani, Darryl Gucwa, Yvette Bunch, Elora Thorpe
    RN, Jo Valenti RN, Michelle Thomas RNC, Johnean Hansen, Mark Eldredge, Liz Crum
    MSN, RN, CCRN, Deborah Tolich RN, Mike Columbus, Lori Carlson LPN, Keith A Samolyk
    CCP, LCP, David Brewington, and Jessica Varisco.  </p>
  <p>Along with
    the many participating healthcare professionals there are a variety of
    volunteers that roll up their sleeves to help with various technical and
    non-technical site and organizational tasks. Special thanks go to Sharon Grant,
    Leon Opolski, Len Buckoltz, Elya Kurktchi, Mike and Pattiann Garcia, Doug Phillips, Glen
    Meador, Mike Hernandez, Robert Johnson, and Debbie Holder.</p>
  <p>What is the
    most important reason why NoBlood continues to be the number one Internet resource
    dedicated to transfusion alternatives and blood management?  It is because of registered
    users like you. How so? Imagine yourself attending a conference. What would you
    think if you walked in the door and only saw a handful of attendees? You would likely
    conclude that there was not very much interest in the theme of the conference. Conversely,
    when thousands of people from around the world come to NoBlood.org, register,
    login and actively participate, visitors realize that there is great interest
    in the subjects discussed there. As a result they are drawn to find out more.</p>
  <p><strong><a name="who"></a>SO WHO IS
    BEHIND NOBLOOD?</strong></p>
  <p>With so much
    questionable information on the web, it is only appropriate to wonder who is
    behind any site you visit. As Executive Director and Webmaster, allow me to
    share a bit of my professional background.</p>
  <p>In 1982 I founded
    a company, now known as <i><a href="http://www.advisor.com/" target="_blank">Advisor Media</a></i>. Its first product was a PC
    database contact manager written in dBase II.  Soon it became apparent that there
    was a pressing need for information related to database application
    development. So I figured, why not start a magazine dedicated to covering this
    topic? I named it <a href="http://my.advisor.com/pub/DataBasedAdvisor" target="_blank"><i>Data Based Advisor Magazine</i></a>. Although most startup magazines
    quickly fail, the <i>Data Based Advisor</i> became the number one trade-journal
    in its niche. Then in 1995 when the magazine had reached a monthly circulation
    of about 50,000, I sold my interest in order to pursue personal goals.</p>
  <p>In 1995 the
    internet was still in its infancy. Having a passion for the subject of what was
    then called bloodless healthcare, I saw an opportunity to develop a website
    that would facilitate collaboration among healthcare professionals and the
    public who were interested or involved in bloodless healthcare. So in 1996 I
    registered the domain noblood.com and began hiring staff as well as inviting
    volunteers. An invaluable help at this point was Jan Wade who generously guided <i>NoBlood’s</i> editorial direction. </p>
  <p>You should
    have seen my home in San Diego!  It went from a bachelor-pad to a
    web-development hub. I must admit that I had mixed feelings when I removed the
    pool-table from the living room and replaced it with six workstation cubicles!
    The den became my office with a rack of servers on one wall connected to a
    dedicated T1 line. In total, there were 12 workstations throughout the house
    with laptops for the bathrooms (just kidding). It was exciting to collaborate
    with experts from around the world as we cataloged information and created feature
    articles. A high point was when Doctor Estioko, M.D., a cardiothoracic surgeon
    and medical director of the Transfusion-Free Medicine &amp; Surgery Center at Saint John’s Health Center, invited me to watch him perform a quadruple by-pass
    operation without blood transfusion.  Though I have never liked operating-room
    scenes, I forced myself to stand on a stool for four hours as I watched the
    operation from start to finish. I must say that I was pretty pleased with myself for toughing it out.</p>
  <p><strong><a name="funded"></a>HOW IS
    NOBLOOD.ORG FUNDED? </strong></p>
  <p>Although I was
    hoping to keeps things simple, it became necessary to incorporate. A California non-profit corporation was formed which we named Bloodless Healthcare
    International, Inc. It is a 501(c)3 federally tax-exempt charitable corporation.
    The operative word here is non-profit. While operating a non-profit organization
    is different than operating a for-profit corporation, they are the same in
    terms of the need to pay for operating expenses.</p>
  <p>Being well… a
    little flush at the time from the sale of my interest in my software and
    magazine publishing company, I began pouring funds and energy into NoBlood.
    Aside from various attempts to invite donations, our mission has always been to
    focus on making the very best website possible.  The necessary financial help would
    come later.</p>
  <p>Well, the
    time has come. I need to bring to your attention that I no longer have the personal
    resources necessary to carry the load of building and running NoBlood.org.
    Users of NoBlood frequently rave about how useful the site is. With that fact
    firmly in mind I am writing to let you know that we find ourselves at a very
    important juncture in our development.</p>
  <p>For NoBlood
    to meeting the current and anticipated demands of time and resources, we need
    to establish a working operating budget. To meet this need, we have launched three
    programs to accommodate corporate and individual sponsoring. These are called
    Pixels Pages, Premium Hospital Listings and Premium Users. </p>
  <p><strong><a name="pixels"></a>PIXELS PAGES </strong></p>
  <p><a
href="http://www.noblood.org/pixels/healthcare" target="_blank">NoBlood Pixels Pages</a> are
    pages where blocks of pixels are purchased that contain images such as
    corporate logos. Pixels can be purchased in blocks of 100 pixels at $0.20 per
    pixel per year. This concept was inspired by the wildly successful website (<a
href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com" target="_blank">www.milliondollarhomepage.com</a>) where
    a college student sold a million pixels at a dollar a pixel. We have three
    different pixels pages, <a href="http://www.noblood.org/pixels/healthcare" target="_blank">Healthcare</a>, <a href="http://www.noblood.org/pixels/corporate" target="_blank">Corporate</a>, <a
href="http://www.noblood.org/pixels/people" target="_blank">People</a> and a page for <a
href="http://www.noblood.org/pixels/test" target="_blank">testing</a>. Please note the
    following features:</p>
  <ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
    <li>Mouse over images. When moving your
      mouse over the images/logos, image and information is presented.</li>
    <li>Link to website. When a person clicks
      on the image, they are taken to the company’s website.</li>
    <li>Click tracking. The number of times
      the image is clicked is presented in the popup.</li>
    <li>Pixels listing. Visitors can view a
      complete list of images and their associated companies.</li>
    <li>Top 10 pixels. Visitors can view the
      top 10 recent and overall clicked images.</li>
    <li>Search. Visitors can quickly enter
      search terms to find company pixels.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The <a
href="http://www.noblood.org/pixels/healthcare" target="_blank">Healthcare Pixels</a> page is
    limited to companies and organizations providing transfusion alternatives and
    blood management related products and services.  By visiting this page you will
    notice that the initial response to this funding program has been very
    gratifying. If you or your company would like to present your product or
    service on the page, feel free to click on the grid and select the blocks you
    wish to use and/or reply to this message along with your contact information.
    The Healthcare Pixels page is shaping up to be the Who’s Who in transfusion
    alternatives and blood management. We encourage you to add a link to this page
    on any web-site and blog you may participate in.</p>
  <p>The <a
href="http://www.noblood.org/pixels/corporate" target="_blank">Corporate Pixels</a> page is
    where non-healthcare related companies can purchase blocks of pixels to show
    their support for advancing this important mission.</p>
  <p>The <a
href="http://www.noblood.org/pixels/people" target="_blank">People Pixels</a> page is where
    individuals can purchase blocks of pixels to show their support for advancing
    this mission. Only difference here is that images are limited to simple icons
    or face shots and there are no links to personal websites.</p>
  <p>Each image
    may occupy up to 64 blocks of pixels. We would be happy to assist with
    preparing images for inclusion from available artwork.</p>
  <p>Understandably,
    we reserve the right to reject any image deemed objectionable.</p>
  <p>Once companies and hospitals have been given sufficient time to place their logo’s on the appropriate page, we will initiate a press campaign designed to draw visitors to see who the leaders are in blood management and transfusion alternatives. Will you be found there?</p>
  <p><strong><a name="hospitals"></a>PREMIUM
    HOSPITAL LISTINGS</strong></p>
  <p>We are
    working to enhance one of the most visited features on NoBlood.org, our
    Hospitals Directory. For years, we have featuring hospitals that have bloodless/blood
    conservation/blood management/transfusion-free programs without charge to the
    listed hospitals. It remains our policy to include any qualified hospitals in
    this list. At this time we are providing a service wherein interested hospitals
    are now invited to pay a modest annual fee to have an enhanced presence on
    NoBlood.org and in our Hospital Directory.</p>
  <p>For the
    majority of hospitals in our directory, we have not had time to contact them
    with this opportunity. In our initial inquiries, we have received strong
    interest. If you are involved in a Hospital Program and would like to find out
    more regarding our Premium Hospital Listing offer, please reply to this message
    with a request for further details. </p>
  <p><strong><a name="users"></a>PREMIUM USERS</strong></p>
  <p>In addition
    to or in place of our pixels pages, those of you who are in a position to and
    interested in having a share in helping us to sustain our operations, you now have
    an opportunity to become a Premium User. We hesitate to use the term Premium
    Member because some may associate that with joining an organization.  In
    reality becoming a Premium User is no different than making a donation to any
    charitable organization. Doing so doesn’t make you a member, but it does make
    you a valuable supporter in its mission or a subscriber to its services.</p>
  <p>There are
    three levels to choose from. </p>
  <ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
    <li>Silver at
      $3 per month. </li>
    <li>Gold at $5
      per month. </li>
    <li>Or Platinum
      at $10 per month. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>At this time,
    there aren’t any advantages for a person to subscribe at the Silver versus Platinum
    level. We offer the three levels so you can decide on what level you would like
    to support our mission. Yes, for the price of a cup of coffee, you can help us continue
    make a tangible difference in peoples lives!</p>
